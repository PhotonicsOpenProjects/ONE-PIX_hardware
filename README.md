# ONE-PIX_harware

The ONE-PIX_hardware repository contains all the files and information to build a case containing all the components of the ONE-PIX kit and their 3D printed attachments.

## Content

This folder contains:

- The [material needed list](https://github.com/PhotonicsOpenProjects/ONE-PIX/wiki/4.-ONE%E2%80%90PIX--Hardware#components-list) file containing raw materials and equipments needed to build the ONE-PIX kit hardware.
- The [hardware building tutorial](https://github.com/PhotonicsOpenProjects/ONE-PIX/wiki/4.-ONE%E2%80%90PIX--Hardware#components-list) file containing details steps to build the ONE-PIX kit.
- [STL files ready to 3D_printing](/STL_file_ready_to_3D_printing) folder containing every files to 3D print components fixation parts of the kit.
- [plans of box sides ready to cut](/plan_of_box_sides_ready_to_cut) folder containing every files to  laser cut sides of the ONE-PIX kit case.
- The [CAO files to modify hardware](/CAO_files_to_modify_hardware) folder containting the complet CAO of the ONE-PIX kit if you want to adapt the hardware to your application.


> **_NOTE:_** You can also buy a premounted and adapted ONE-PIX kit [here](https://www.photonics-bretagne.com/fr/product/imageur-hyperspectral-one-pix-pop/). 
> Keep in mind that it is also the best way to help us maintaining the forge, integrating contribution and even propose one day industrial implementation of this technology for the broader audience and usage possible.



## Contributing 

### Mounting experience

If you use it from a already assemble kit, and do not found a detail on the manual, tell us !
If you assemble it by yourself and found some simpliest or smartest way to do it, please share !
If you encounter difficulties, have suggestions or even just cheers the developpers, do not hesitate again !

### Use Cases

Any questions, pedagogical or in a front of science, very applied or meta-conceptual are interesting for us and other users. A brief description and welcome message on this repository will be greatly apreciated. If we are curious enough we will contact you.

### New functions

As you will rapidly catch-it : this simple set-up has an infinity of potential developements, applications and usages. Feel free to play with it once it works at your place. 
If you find new tricks, feel free to share it with us and the community. We will dedicate ourselves (on the limits of our daily hours) to make the best effort to integrate and promote to the community every contribution with the greater respect to your credits. 

### Your version

If you tried a new sensors, an other mechanical plan, you can freely create your own forks but if you consider it could be usefull to keep consistency with other develepment and insturmental choice, we can discuss on int√©grating also , spectormeter wrappers or even more crazy evolution in the main.

## Important remarks

:bulb: **Tip:** Do not forget to have fun... because we had some making it for you !
